# CheckpointSuristin-week1


A weekly checkpoint test in Java after the very first week at AW Academy.

The task was to create a program that prints out the model, dimensions etc. of a machine 

- Only the details of the machine were given in the instructions, and an example of the format in which it had to be printed
and how the details needed to be added to the object
- Use of classes and OOP were particulary tested
